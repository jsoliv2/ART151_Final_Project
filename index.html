    <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
    <p>
      They say that "you are your own enemy". Only you know your own flaws, mistakes, regrets, and fears. Because of that, only you can bring yourself down when you judge your own abilities. Now you must face these vices head-on in a battle inside your own mind to better yourself. You directly control both the hero and the villain’s movements and attacks, and you must face your reflection through the screen or webcam as you wear your dark side down. In this retro NES Zelda-inspired game, it won’t be so easy to face yourself. Never give up and you’ll prevail!
